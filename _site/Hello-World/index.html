  <h1>Interactive SpriteKit Scene in Swift Playground</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I wanted to get a Swift Playground setup that would let me mess with SpriteKit. I found this Nyan Cat Example, which shows an increasingly complicated example of setting up a Nyan Cat scene. Eventually it has the cat busting around, complete with music and everything. What it’s missing is any form of user input.</p>

<p>This example is an OS X playground. This means it will run the graphics natively, which is good, but to my knowledge there is no way of getting user input. To do so, you’re going to need to make an iOS playgorund, subclass UIViewController, and set that as the XCPlayground.liveView.</p>
