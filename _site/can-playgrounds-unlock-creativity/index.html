  <h1>Can the Playgrounds App Unlock Creativity on iPad?</h1>


  <div class="entry">
    <p>I was sitting beside a toddler on the plane ride to WWDC. He spent the entire flight on an iPad. His main activities were watching <em>Cars</em> and finger painting on some paint app. Good diversions for a long ride, but not the most inspiring use of a young mind’s time. Mobile devices simply don’t faciliate creative output in most cases. Hopefully, <a href="http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Apple’s new Playgrounds app</a> will help blaze that trail in an important context: programming literacy.</p>

<p>In a time where people are being given Facebook accounts before they’re self-aware, I don’t think it’s ethical for us to neglect their education in how to control technology. Without efforts to teach them that the functionality of these devices are malleable, the screens become more like blinds than portals into a creative universe. Teaching that creativity is possible directly on the device where the content is being consumed represents a promising possible direction.</p>

<p>Playgrounds have an educational focus and are distributed on a platform that is often the first technology available to young minds. If even a fraction of the time spent on iPads goes towards that sort of creative thinking, we’re giving spark to a potential creative flame that could be lost in the consumption-heavy context of life on an iPad. The fact that Swift can be <em>actually</em> be deployed in an increasing number of practical production contexts takes this endeavor from a sandboxed learning exercise to a serious opportunity for aspiring programmers.</p>
